Sited on a spacious lot on Button Street, this design investigates the close adjacencies and relationships between two distinct units within a single building envelope. Capped with a double gable roof and fronted with a shared porch – elements that are pulled from the architectural language of the street – the facade presents two home identities. 

A sculptural CLT light well guides this stealing of space. Designed to direct light into the living space of the individual unit, it reaches into the family’s living space, allowing the latter to wrap around it and extend above the single unit. The CLT acts as both a figural and literal core, spatially enwrapping each user within. As the core projects upward, it unfolds to create a rhythmic double gable for quintessential shelter.
