Through the lens of the Columbus House mission, we aim to explore a flexible design that can adapt to shelter as many people as possible. Changeable partitions and inverted porches allow us to accommodate a wide range of family makeups, and also allow tenants to choose their level of interaction. Shifting enclosures and spatial exchanges follow the changing needs of the individuals experiencing homelessness in New Haven.
