Our home design is generated by three key values: identity, privacy, and connection. The house seeks to provide a place of comfort and security for its residents, while fostering bonds with the surrounding environment. A tree-like CLT structure stretches through the house, creating openings that connect to its surroundings. The structure defines the front and back porches, the living spaces on both unit upper levels, and a tall light-well that naturally illuminates the building. Our tree acts as the primary connection to the outside, and serves as a powerful formal organizer.
