Our design draws from two major considerations - the context of the neighborhood and the needs of the Columbus House clients. As our house and its occupants will be new to the neighborhood, we have designed a home that integrates into Button Street through references to adjacent homes and adds vibrancy to the existing landscape. Conversations with our clients emphasized the importance of privacy, informing our decision to allow for complete autonomy within each individual unit, with discrete moments that offer optional interaction. Our house materializes these priorities spatially, technically, and conceptually, providing a contextual and comfortable home where the residents can shape their own space and experience.
