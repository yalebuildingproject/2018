Our project spatially and materially collages the housing masses of the two units around a shared outdoor space. This positive void of the shared outdoor space both divides and connects the units, negotiating private and collective spaces. Through this outdoor space, we are offering our clients, who will be sharing this experience of transitioning into housing, space where they can interact as neighbors. The outdoor space is intended to facilitate gathering around meals and to cultivate social relationships embedded in preparing and enjoying food with others. Additionally, it maintains a sense of privacy for our clients through the separation of the units on the ground floor. The CLT that structurally supports the bedrooms on the second floor, frames and defines the outdoor space and tectonically and experientially mediates connections from each unitsâ€™ individual kitchen to the shared space.
