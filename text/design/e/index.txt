Our design is predicated on two simple, yet fundamental characteristics of a home â€“ ownership and privacy. The two units share a front porch on Button Street and have views of the larger site on the second story. Due to the asymmetries in the program and site conditions, we designed the studio and family homes to wrap around each other. The vertical alignment of the two units on the first floor turns into a horizontal alignment on the second, giving both parties access and views of the landscape. The interlocking CLT forms embody our response to cohabitation.
