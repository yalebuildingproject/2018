Given the double lot at 43 Button street, we propose to site this house across the streetside edge of the property. The house extends to fill the width of the site, differing from the typical orientation of homes on the block but echoing the continuous, textured streetscape of porches and entries. This asserts the residentsâ€™ presence in the Button Street community with a generous front porch that participates in the neighborly culture of a New Haven block. Once beyond the threshold of the porch, each unit opens expansively onto the enclosed backyard garden.
