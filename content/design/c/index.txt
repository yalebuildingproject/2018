We explore the techniques of collage and montage as potential means of strategizing spatial and material organization, divisions and connections between the two units, and negotiating boundaries between public, private, and collective spaces. This scheme fragments the New Haven house typology, redistributing massing around defined outdoor spaces. These outdoor spaces are intended to facilitate gathering around meals and to cultivate social relationships, while maintaining a sense of privacy for our clients through the separation of units on the ground floor.
