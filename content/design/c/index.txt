Team C is exploring techniques of collage and montage as potential means of strategizing spatial and material organization, divisions and connections between the two units, and negotiating boundaries between public, private, and collective spaces. Their scheme fragments a typical New Haven house, redistributing massing around defined outdoor spaces. These outdoor spaces are intended to facilitate gathering around meals and to cultivate the social relationships embedded in our cultural proclivities for preparing and enjoying food with others, all the while maintaining a sense of privacy for our clients through the separation of the units on the ground floor.
