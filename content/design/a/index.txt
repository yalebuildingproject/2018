Our proposal places the house along the streetside edge of the lot to assert our tenantsâ€™ presence on Button Street and provide an enclosed, private backyard. Within the volume, two nodes anchor each distinct households. To provide agency within the separate households, the volume unhooks at each end and re-couples to form a central shared anchor.  The anchors are vertical voids within the space, and bring light through the two units. They alternate with CLT frames to generate a rhythm of structural bays that create intimate enclosures and vertical striations across the volume.
