Our scheme proposes to unite the efficiency unit and the family unit around a shared central courtyard as a way to scale the large lot down to a more intimate size. The building masses are generated by a CLT matrix and contextualized by a screen envelope that aligns with two neighborhood datums: the porchline and the first-story roofline.
